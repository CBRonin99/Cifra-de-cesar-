## Strings
Like many other popular programming languages, strings in Python are arrays of bytes representing unicode characters. However, Python does not have a character data type, a single character is simply a string with a length of 1. Square brackets can be used to access elements of the string.
- [import sys] - it lets us access system-specific parameters and functions. import sys. First, we have to import the sys module in our program before running any functions. sys.modules. This function provides the name of the existing python modules which have been imported!
- [alphabets]  it's truly a alphabet
- [f = f = str(string_input.read())] - Python has a built-in string class named "str" with many handy features (there is an older module named "string", f, f calls de string 
- [key = 3]  with this key later on we will be able to itulize the alphabet-key sequence or (alphabets represented by "pos" minus key (pos - key) and the value will be divided -> % by the number of characters in the ASCII table (pos - key) % 100
- [-string_output] There are several ways to format output in this case string_output pulls the code out
- [a] a = int(input("Digite 1:")) the Ã  is to create the user's string to know that when typing a in case 1 it will encrypt the .txt file

-Al the point .close() it's for file close-up 
- [cript and descript]  is for encrypting and decrypting logically but calling string crypto and then a dot writelines we can actually encrypt the file repeating that same version but with the descript we will be able to unencrypt the encryption
- ['r', 'w'] The r means reading file; r+ means reading and writing the file. The w means writing file; w+ means reading and writing the file.
